To install go to `~/.config/easyeffects` and clone the repository presets `git clone git@github.com:josevictorferreira/.easyeffects.git .` 

## My Current Presets

### Input:

  - Voice Boost with Equalizer and Noise Reduction for meetings, gaming or pair programming.

### Output:

 - Perfect EQ, for listening music and default audio (tested on a Sennheiser HD560S headphone).
 - Voice Clarity, focus for boosting voice, used mostly for listening podcasts with poor audio recorded.
